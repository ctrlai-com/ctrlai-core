# Ctrl AI: API Specification (Protocol Summary)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-02-17

## 1. Introduction

This document summarizes the *protocol-level* aspects of the Ctrl AI API.  It describes the general principles and data formats, *without* specifying the exact endpoints of any particular implementation.

**For the complete, interactive API specification of a specific Ctrl AI implementation (including all endpoints and schemas), please refer to the Swagger UI documentation provided by that implementation.**  For example, the reference implementation provides this documentation at `[Implementation-Specific URL]/docs`.

## 2. Base URL

The base URL for a Ctrl AI API is implementation-specific.  Each implementation will provide its own base URL.

## 3. Authentication

Ctrl AI implementations *must* use **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect** for authentication.  This ensures secure and standardized access control.  Specific details of the OAuth 2.0 flow (e.g., authorization URLs, token URLs) will be provided by each implementation.

## 4. Data Formats

*   **Request Body:** `application/json`
*   **Response Body:** `application/json` (with the intention to transition to `application/ld+json` in the future for full JSON-LD compliance).  All data exchanged with the API *must* conform to the [Ctrl AI JSON Schema](.../path/to/schema.json).

## 5. Error Handling

Ctrl AI APIs use standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure.  Error responses *should* be in JSON format, with at least a `detail` field providing a human-readable error message.

```json
{
  "detail": "Error message describing the problem."
}
```

Common error codes include:

*   400 Bad Request: Invalid request data.
*   401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid authentication credentials.
*   403 Forbidden: The user does not have permission to access the resource.
*   404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found.
*   429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded.
*   500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

## 6. Interaction Model

### 6.1. Querying Ctrl AIs

Ctrl AI APIs must support querying Ctrl AIs based on:

*   Vector Search: Clients should be able to provide a text query, which will be converted to a vector embedding and used to find semantically similar Ctrl AIs.
*   Metadata Filtering: Clients must be able to filter Ctrl AIs based on their metadata, including:
    *   type
    *   scope
    *   source
    *   confidence
    *   keywords
    *   dateCreated, dateModified, expires, validFrom (timestamps)
    *   Filtering operators:
        *   Equal, Not equal, In List, Greater than, Lower than, Contains
*   Combined Queries: Clients must be able to combine vector search and metadata filtering in a single query.
*   Pagination: The API should support pagination for large result sets.

## 6.2. Creating, Updating, and Deleting Ctrl AIs

Ctrl AI APIs must provide mechanisms for:

*   Creating new Ctrl AIs.
*   Retrieving existing Ctrl AIs by ID.
*   Updating existing Ctrl AIs.
*   Deleting Ctrl AIs.

## 6.3. Data Representation

All Ctrl AI data exchanged with the API must conform to the Ctrl AI JSON Schema and use the terms defined in the Ctrl AI Custom Vocabulary.

## 7. Extensibility
The Ctrl AI protocol is designed to be extensible. Developers can:

*   Define custom type values (following a namespaced convention, e.g., mycompany:my_custom_type).
*   Add custom properties within the value field of a Ctrl AI (using JSON-LD's extensibility features).

## 8. Versioning

Ctrl AI implementations should use semantic versioning (SemVer) for their APIs.
